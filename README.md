# tpmc - "test project mine craft" :)
This is just a simple test project to find out how minecraft mods could be made. If you want to test this overpowered mod, you have to use forge 1.10.2.

# What can I do with this mod?
Nothing special. You are able to place one new block the "harvest10"-Block. This block harvest 10 units 3x3 blocks depending on the side you right-click on this block.
You can craft this block with four dirt-blocks. In creative mode this block is placed at the building blocks tab.
